# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving the Copilot Billing Forecast toolbox. Please
read the privacy constraint and development guidelines below before making changes.

## ⚠️ PRIVACY - READ THIS FIRST

**Uploaded usage data MUST NEVER leave the client.** All CSV parsing, analysis,
and forecasting happens entirely in the browser. There is **no server-side
processing, no upload to any API, and no persistence** of the user's data
beyond the current browser session (in-memory / optional local storage only).

When adding new tools or features, **never** send the parsed report data to a
server, API route, telemetry endpoint, or third party. Treat this as a hard
architectural constraint.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js** (App Router, TypeScript) - the application framework.
- **GitHub Primer React** (`@primer/react`) - UI component library for an authentic
  GitHub look (Header, PageLayout, NavList, SegmentedControl, FormControl, etc.).
  Theming comes from `@primer/primitives` and icons from `@primer/octicons-react`.
- **CSV parsing** - client-side (PapaParse) only.
- **Charts** - Recharts for the forecast visualizations.
- **Toasts** - Sonner for client-side notifications.

## Architecture / conventions

- All report-data handling lives in client components (`"use client"`). No API routes
  touch user data.
- Parsing/forecasting logic lives in `src/lib/` so it is testable and reusable across tools.
- UI is built with Primer React; `ThemeProvider` + `BaseStyles` are set up in
  `src/components/providers.tsx` and the primitives light theme is imported in the
  root layout.
- Each tool is a route/view registered in a single sidebar config so adding a tool is
  a one-place change.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 and load a usage report CSV.

## Development guidelines

- Keep the **client-only data** constraint inviolable.
- Add UI elements with **Primer React** (`@primer/react`) components; prefer them over
  hand-rolled markup. Use `@primer/octicons-react` for icons.
- Register new tools in the sidebar config and add a corresponding view.
- Keep parsing tolerant of all three report variants and legacy columns.
